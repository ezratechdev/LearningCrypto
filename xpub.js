//This is a public key which can be used to generate multiple public keys
//They start with a format of xpub....
// xpub means Extended Public Key

/**
 * You can think of the xpub key as a kind of master key from which an almost endless amount of public keys – and thus Bitcoin addresses – can be generated.
 */

/**
 * The counterpart, the private key, is the so-called seed, which is often encoded in the form of 12 to 24 words. These words must be kept safe.
 */

/**
 * The xPub key is a public key, which can be passed on without any problems
 */

/**
 * If you accept Bitcoin payments as a merchant, you have to store this xPub key in your store, so that the store can present new Bitcoin address to the buyer each time
 */

/**
 * If you don’t have a hardware wallet, you can create a Bitcoin wallet via Electrum
